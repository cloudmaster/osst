OSST - The Online Service Signup Tool
-------------------------------------

OSST is a framework for automated account signups at online
service providers. The scope is on everything-as-a-service.
Examples are cloud computing services, e-mail and further
communication, social networks, and basically all other
domains as defined by e.g. the XaaS domain ontologies in
WSMO4IoS: http://serviceplatform.org/wiki/WSMO4IoS

All signups are bound to an identity which typically is retrieved from
a vCard. Signups can have dependencies which together with
the location of the signup agent code are described in *.agents
description files.

OSST is integrated with the ConQo semantic service registry
(http://serviceplatform.org/wiki/ConQo) to retrieve new service
descriptions for certain requirements and executable signup agents along
with them.
For less sophisticated requirements, it works on local INI-style service
descriptions and directly on locally provided agents, though.

Parameters which cannot be inferred from service descriptions and
agents are prompted interactively from the user.

The implementation of OSST requires Perl with the WWW::Mechanize,
SOAP::Lite and Text::vCard modules, plus some implementation-specific
modules: LWP::Simple, XML::XPath etc..
